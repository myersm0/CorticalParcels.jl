# CorticalParcels
This Julia package supplies a set of abstractions for conveniently and performantly working with parcels -- or regions of interest -- in the context of the surface-space representation of the cerebral cortex. It builds upon the `Hemisphere` and `CorticalSurface` types from [CorticalSurfaces.jl](https://github.com/myersm0/CorticalSurfaces.jl) and provides the foundation for my high performance implementation of a well-known parcel-generation and -evaluation algorithm in [WatershedParcellation.jl](https://github.com/myersm0/WatershedParcellation.jl).

## Installation
Within Julia:
```
using Pkg
Pkg.add(url = "http://github.com/myersm0/CorticalParcels.jl")
```

## Usage
Coming soon.
